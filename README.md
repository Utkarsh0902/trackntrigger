# Track-n-Trigger

This app was built as a project for the Object Oriented Programming course. This is also the first android application that I ever made and hence I wouldn't be making a lot of changes to it, trying to let it be a metric to how things evolve in the future.

## Purpose:
This app is a version of an inventory management application, aimed at helping people with their household stocks.
  * Google login for new users
  * Lets users add new categories of items
  * Add/ delete items to different categories
