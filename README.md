***Temporary name for the app, will be changed soon.***    


This app was built as a project for the Object Oriented Programming course. 
This is also the first android application that I ever made and hence I wouldn't be making a lot of changes to it, 
trying to let it be a metric to how things evolve in the future.

### This app is a version of an inventory management application, aimed at helping people with their household stocks. 
* Google login for new users
